- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ballast, which is my handle on Github. Usually they call me Birgit.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web-Development, reading, sports, music, politics and lots more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OOP for Javascript!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something I can handle ;-)
- 📫 How to reach me: borgotttttttt@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started programming only 2 years ago, meanwhile I am already 43 but sometimes you gotta take a leap.

- I code with Javascript, HTML 5, CSS 3 and will soon learn about Angular.
